Angular services
	are not same as webservice or WebApi or rest service
	Service is a broad category encompassing any value, function, or feature that an app needs. A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose. It should do something specific and do it well.

Angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusability. 
By separating a component's view-related functionality from other kinds of processing, you can 
make your component classes lean and efficient.

	Angular builtIn services for making an HTTP or asnchronous call to the data
		http and this was inside a built module called HttpModule  
		httpClient and this belongs to HttpClientModule
	JS - callbacks
	     promises
	     async and await
	Angular popularly uses Observables 

	promises can cannot be cancelled but observables can be
	promises are eager loaded and observables are lazy loaded

			2. Configure the routes using forRoot([

forRoot method should be used to configure the route if your application has only one module
			3. <router-outlet></router-outlet>

Different ways in passing the service in Providers array
Interceptor and resolve are almost same except interceptor is a service that implements HttpInterceptor


//defining an interceptor
export class FirstInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor{
intercept(req:HttpRequest<any>,next:HttpHandler):Observable<HttpInterceptor>{
	//code
	}


How to connect your interceptor with the application
